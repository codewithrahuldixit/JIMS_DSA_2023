Q7 :Problem Statement: You are given an array. The task is to reverse the array and print it. 

Example 1:
Input: N = 5, arr[] = {5,4,3,2,1}
Output: {1,2,3,4,5}
Explanation: Since the order of elements gets reversed the first element will occupy the fifth position, the second element occupies the fourth position and so on.

Example 2:
Input: N=6 arr[] = {10,20,30,40}
Output: {40,30,20,10}
Explanation: Since the order of elements gets reversed the first element will occupy the fifth position, the second element occupies the fourth position and so on.

Q8: Check if the given String is Palindrome or not
Problem Statement: “Given a string, check if the string is palindrome or not.”  A string is said to be palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the string.

Example 1:
Input: Str =  “ABCDCBA”
Output: Palindrome
Explanation: String when reversed is the same as string.

Example 2:
Input: Str = “TAKE U FORWARD”
Output: Not Palindrome
Explanation: String when reversed is not the same as string.
